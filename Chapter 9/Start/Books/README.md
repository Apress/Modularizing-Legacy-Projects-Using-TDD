## Obtaining API Key for Books
Books project, which was first introduced in Chapter 6 and is used heavily in the remaining chapters, highly depends on New York Times API. For the app to function properly you'll need to obtain an API key and use it in your project while coding along. In order to obtain an API key, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to this [sign up page](https://developer.nytimes.com/accounts/create) and create an account.
2. Log in to your account after verifying it
3. Go to this [link](https://developer.nytimes.com/my-apps) and press on Add App
4. Enter any name and enable "Books API"
5. Create the app.
6. This will take you to your app's page and you'll find the API key under the section "API Keys"
7. Now replace all occurrences of "YOUR_API_KEY" in the project with the newly created API key.
8. We recommend to replace all occurrences of "YOUR_API_KEY" accross the whole repo to avoid running into the same issue every chapter. A simple global Find and Replace will be sufficient.
